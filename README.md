Link to Tableau Story [NYC Citibike](https://public.tableau.com/views/NYCCitibikeChallenge_16176058216610/NYCCitiBike?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link) for Module 14

## Purpose of Project
* To use Tableau to visualize the story of NYC Citibike usage to highlight useful information that could lead to starting CitiBike in other cities, in this case Des Moines, Iowa.

## Analysis - Important Variables
*  Gender - Who uses the bike service?
*  Time of day - When are the peak hours of usage?  When are the off peak hours so that maintainence can be performed
*  Age - Recalculation of Birthdate to Age and sorted into bins to show how old the user is.  This is important if Des Moines has an older age demographic combined with a lower population it could be detrimental to business.
